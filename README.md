# Mobile Gacha API

## Full Stack Capstone Project

With the success of mobile gacha games in the last decade players look to online databases to help them search through the vast number of cards availible to them. This application is built to create an API that is simple but easily extensible to meet the needs growing number of mobile gacha games available.

In this application we will start with a common structure that mobile gacha games use. This structure includes the following models:

- Characters - A cast of reoccuring characters that the game features in the main card system.
- Cards - A pool of cards available to 'pull' from via gacha mechanics. Each card features a character and has their own unique attributes.
- Skills - Various skills attached to different cards that serve to add depth to gameplay by allowing players perform better in-game.

This common structure is found in many gacha games and can be very much likened to trading card games in a digital format. If you are familiar with either mobile gacha games or trading cards it's easy to see how these games are variants of the same theme. Be it different naming conventions or extending typing or classes, if you take notice of these games' patterns you should be have no problem extending or modifying the database models to meet fit any number of games' requirements.
